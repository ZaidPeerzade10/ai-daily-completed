Create an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies `StandardScaler` to the features and then fits a `Ridge` regressor.\n3. Define a hyperparameter grid for the `Ridge` regressor within the pipeline, tuning the `alpha` parameter across at least 3 distinct values (e.g., `[0.1, 1.0, 10.0]`).\n4. Use `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` with the pipeline and the defined parameter grid to find the best hyperparameters. Use `neg_mean_squared_error` as the scoring metric and apply 3-fold cross-validation.\n5. Report the best hyperparameters found by `GridSearchCV` and the corresponding best score (remembering to convert the `neg_mean_squared_error` back to a positive MSE value).",

Hyperparameter grid: Accurately defines the `param_grid` for `ridge__alpha` with 4 distinct values, exceeding the minimum of 3.\n4. GridSearchCV usage: Correctly configures `GridSearchCV` with the pipeline, parameter grid, `neg_mean_squared_error` scoring, and `cv=3`.\n5. Reporting results: Accurately retrieves and prints the best hyperparameters and correctly converts the `neg_mean_squared_error` to a positive MSE.\n\nFrom a code design, logic, and adherence to requirements perspective, this solution is flawless. However, the `Execution stderr` indicates a 'Package install failure'. This is a critical runtime error, preventing the code from executing and thereby failing to complete the task. While the code itself is exemplary, a data science task is not considered 'fulfilled' if the provided solution cannot run due to environmental issues. Therefore, despite the excellent code quality, the submission cannot pass due to this operational failure.",

        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate Python code is exemplary. It perfectly addresses every single requirement outlined in the task:\n\n1.  **Dataset Generation**: A synthetic regression dataset is correctly generated using `make_regression` with precisely 500 samples and 5 features, meeting the specified criteria.\n2.  **Pipeline Creation**: An `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` is correctly constructed, integrating `StandardScaler` followed by a `Ridge` regressor, as required.\n3.  **Hyperparameter Grid**: The `param_grid` for the `Ridge` regressor's `alpha` parameter is correctly defined, including 4 distinct values (`[0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]`), which exceeds the minimum of 3, and uses the correct `ridge__alpha` prefix as per the hint.\n4.  **GridSearchCV Application**: `GridSearchCV` is correctly instantiated with the pipeline and parameter grid, using `neg_mean_squared_error` as the scoring metric and 3-fold cross-validation. The inclusion of `n_jobs=-1` and `verbose=1` are good practices for efficiency and feedback.\n5.  **Result Reporting**: The best hyperparameters and the corresponding best score are accurately extracted and reported. Crucially, the `neg_mean_squared_error` is correctly converted back to a positive MSE value before reporting, as specified in the hint.\n\nThe code is well-structured, easy to understand, and includes informative print statements to track progress. While the `Execution stderr` indicates a 'Package install failure', this appears to be an environmental issue preventing the script from running, rather than a defect in the provided Python code itself. The code's logic and adherence to the task specifications are flawless.",
