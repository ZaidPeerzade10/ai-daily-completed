Here are the implementation steps for a Python ML engineer:

1.  **Synthesize the Dataset:** Create a pandas DataFrame with 1000 rows. Populate `feature_A` using a uniform distribution, `feature_B` using a normal distribution, `feature_C` using an exponential distribution, and `feature_D` using a Poisson distribution. Ensure all these features are numerical.
2.  **Engineer Interaction Features:** Create two new columns: `interaction_AB` by computing the product of `feature_A` and `feature_B`, and `interaction_CD` by computing the product of `feature_C` and `feature_D`.
3.  **Calculate Initial Skewness:** Compute the skewness for all numerical columns in the DataFrame. This includes the original four features and the two newly created interaction features.
4.  **Identify Skewed Features:** From the calculated skewness values, identify all numerical features (original and interaction) that have a skewness value strictly greater than 0.75.
5.  **Apply Log1p Transformation:** For each feature identified in the previous step, apply a `np.log1p` transformation. Replace the original column in the DataFrame with its newly transformed version.
6.  **Display Transformed Data and Final Skewness:** Display the head (first few rows) of the modified DataFrame to observe the changes. Subsequently, calculate and display the skewness for all numerical features in the DataFrame after the transformations have been applied.
