Create two new interaction features: `interaction_AB` (the product of `feature_A` and `feature_B`) and `interaction_CD` (the product of `feature_C` and `feature_D`).\n2.  Identify all numerical features (original and new) that have a skewness value greater than 0.75.\n3.  For each identified skewed feature, apply a `np.log1p` transformation, replacing the original feature column with its transformed version.\n4.

        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate code provides a comprehensive and accurate solution to the task. \n\n1.  **Synthetic Dataset Creation**: The synthetic DataFrame is correctly generated with the specified distributions and row count. `np.random.seed(42)` ensures reproducibility.\n2.  **Interaction Features**: `interaction_AB` and `interaction_CD` are correctly calculated as products of the respective features.\n3.  **Skewness Detection**: The code accurately identifies numerical features with skewness greater than 0.75 using `df.skew()`. The initial skewness values demonstrate that `feature_C` and `interaction_CD` are indeed skewed as intended by the problem design.\n4.  **Log1p Transformation**: `np.log1p` is applied correctly and exclusively to the identified skewed features, replacing the original columns. This demonstrates proper conditional transformation.\n5.  **Display of Results**: The `head()` of the DataFrame is shown before and after key steps, and the skewness values are displayed both initially and after transformation, clearly illustrating the impact of the log transformation on the identified skewed features. The skewness of `feature_C` and `interaction_CD` significantly reduced, validating the transformation.\n\nThe code is well-structured, easy to understand, and includes informative print statements that guide the user through the pipeline steps. No runtime errors occurred, and all functional requirements are met to a high standard.",
