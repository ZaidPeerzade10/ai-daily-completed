    "task": "Given a pandas DataFrame containing at least four numerical features (`feature_A`, `feature_B`, `feature_C`, `feature_D`):\n1.  Create two new interaction features: `interaction_AB` (the product of `feature_A` and `feature_B`) and `interaction_CD` (the product of `feature_C` and `feature_D`).\n2.  Identify all numerical features (original and new) that have a skewness value greater than 0.75.\n3.  For each identified skewed feature, apply a `np.log1p` transformation, replacing the original feature column with its transformed version.\n4.  Display the head of the modified DataFrame and the skewness of all features after transformation.",

    "hint": "Start by creating your synthetic DataFrame with `pd.DataFrame()` and `np.random` functions. Use `df.skew()` to quickly calculate skewness for all numerical columns. Remember `np.log1p(x)` handles zero values gracefully.",

The `feature_C` and `interaction_CD` features were correctly identified in the example output.\n4.  **Log Transformation**: `np.log1p` is correctly applied only to the identified highly skewed features, replacing the original columns as requested.\n5.  **Display**: The head of the DataFrame is displayed at relevant stages, and the skewness of all numerical features (both original and new) is shown before and after transformation, clearly demonstrating the effect of the log transformation.\n\nThe use of clear print statements at each step makes the execution flow very easy to follow. No runtime errors occurred, and the output matches expectations.",
