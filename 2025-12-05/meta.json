Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) using `train_test_split`.\n3. Train a `LogisticRegression` model on the training data.\n4. Predict class labels and class probabilities for the positive class on the test set.\n5. Calculate and print the following evaluation metrics for the test set predictions: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.\n6. Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the model using `matplotlib.pyplot`, clearly labeling axes and adding a title. Include the AUC score in the plot legend.",

It demonstrates a clear understanding of all task requirements, including data generation, splitting, model training, prediction, comprehensive metric calculation, and professional visualization of the ROC curve. All necessary imports are present, `random_state` is used for reproducibility, and the output formatting is clean and informative.\n\nHowever, the reported 'Execution stderr: Package install failure' is a critical runtime issue. While the Python code itself is logically flawless and correctly implements the solution, the inability to install necessary packages (like `sklearn` or `matplotlib`) means the script cannot run and therefore fails to achieve any part of the task in practice. As per the instructions, runtime errors are considered serious issues, and a package installation failure is a fundamental impediment to execution.\n\nTherefore, despite the high quality of the code's design and logic, its practical failure to execute results in a low score and a 'fail' status. The next attempt should focus on ensuring all required packages are correctly installed and available in the execution environment.",

        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate code is exemplary. It meticulously addresses all requirements outlined in the task:\n\n1.  **Dataset Generation**: `make_classification` is used correctly with the specified parameters (1000 samples, 10 features, 2 informative, 2 classes). Additional beneficial parameters like `n_redundant=0`, `weights=[0.5, 0.5]` for balanced classes, and `flip_y=0.01` for noise are included, demonstrating a thoughtful approach.\n2.  **Dataset Splitting**: `train_test_split` is used with the correct 80/20 ratio, `random_state` for reproducibility, and importantly, `stratify=y` to ensure balanced class distribution across splits.\n3.  **Model Training**: A `LogisticRegression` model is initialized with `random_state` and a suitable solver (`liblinear`), then correctly trained on the training data.\n4.  **Prediction**: Both class labels (`y_pred`) and positive class probabilities (`y_proba`) are accurately predicted on the test set.\n5.  **Metric Calculation**: All requested evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC) are correctly calculated using `sklearn.metrics` functions and printed clearly with appropriate formatting.\n6.  **ROC Curve Plotting**: The ROC curve is plotted using `matplotlib.pyplot`, with `fpr` and `tpr` derived from `roc_curve`. Axes are clearly labeled, a descriptive title is present, and the AUC score is correctly included in the plot legend. A random classifier baseline is also included, which is a good practice.\n\nThe code demonstrates excellent adherence to best practices, including setting a `RANDOM_STATE`, using `stratify` in `train_test_split`, and providing informative print statements. The only minor, almost non-existent point, is the import of `pandas` which is not used; however, this does not detract from the quality or correctness of the solution in any way. All key requirements are fulfilled to a very high standard.",
