# Review for 2025-12-30

Score: 0.2
Pass: False

The candidate code perfectly addresses all aspects of the task, from dataset generation with non-linearity, data splitting and scaling, to building, compiling, training, and evaluating a Keras model, and finally visualizing the results. The code is well-structured, includes necessary imports, sets random seeds for reproducibility, and provides informative print statements. 

However, the provided 'Execution stderr' explicitly states 'Package install failure'. As a strict reviewer, runtime errors are considered serious issues. Although the code's logic is fundamentally correct and well-implemented, its inability to execute successfully due to environment issues means the task was not completed. This prevents the demonstration of actual model training and prediction, and thus, the task is considered failed.

The score reflects the high quality of the code itself, but the 'pass' status is false due to the critical execution failure. A retry is needed to resolve the environment issue and ensure successful execution.
