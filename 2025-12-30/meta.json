    "task": "1. Generate a synthetic regression dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_regression` with 1000 samples, 3 informative features. Modify the target `y` to introduce a non-linear relationship (e.g., `y_original + 2 * X[:, 0]**2 + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, size=1000)`).\n2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.\n3. Apply `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` to the features (`X`) on the training data and transform both training and testing sets.\n4. Build a simple sequential neural network model using `tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential`. The model should have:\n    *   An input layer matching the number of features.\n    *   At least one hidden `Dense` layer with `relu` activation (e.g., 32 units).\n    *   An output `Dense` layer with a single unit and linear activation.\n5. Compile the model using the `adam` optimizer and `mean_squared_error` loss.\n6. Train the model on the scaled training data for a suitable number of epochs (e.g., 50-100) and a batch size.\n7. Evaluate the trained model's performance on the scaled test set, reporting the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n8. Visualize the model's predictions against the actual test target values using a scatter plot. Add a perfect prediction line (y=x) for comparison and label axes appropriately.",

Inclusion of `validation_split` and `verbose=0` are good practices.\n- **Evaluation:** Model evaluation on the test set is performed, and MSE is clearly reported.\n- **Visualization:** The scatter plot correctly compares predictions vs. actual values, includes the perfect prediction line (`y=x`), and has all necessary labels and enhancements.\n- **Reproducibility:** Excellent use of `np.random.seed` and `tf.random.set_seed` for reproducibility.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Execution Failure:** The primary and only issue is the 'Package install failure' reported in `stderr`. While the code itself is flawless and robust, it failed to execute because essential libraries (likely TensorFlow, given the context) could not be installed in the environment. This prevents the task from being completed and the experiment from running.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code itself demonstrates a strong understanding of the task and relevant ML/DL concepts. However, a strict reviewer must mark the task as incomplete due to the inability to execute the code and perform the requested experiment. The `needs_retry` flag is set to true to indicate that the problem lies with the execution environment rather than the code's inherent quality, which is very high.",

This overrides any correctness in the code's logic, as the task cannot be demonstrated or verified.\n\nAssuming the environment issues were resolved, the code itself seems well-structured and follows the instructions:\n- Dataset generation with non-linearity: Correctly implemented.\n- Data splitting: Correct.\n- Scaling: Correct use of `StandardScaler`.\n- Model building: Correct `Sequential` model with appropriate layers and activations.\n- Model compilation: Correct optimizer and loss function.\n- Model training: Uses suitable epochs and batch size.\n- Evaluation: Reports MSE as requested.\n- Visualization: Generates a scatter plot with a perfect prediction line and appropriate labels.\n- Reproducibility: Seeds are set.\n\nHowever, due to the execution failure, the task cannot be considered completed.

As a strict reviewer, runtime errors are considered serious issues. Although the code's logic is fundamentally correct and well-implemented, its inability to execute successfully due to environment issues means the task was not completed. This prevents the demonstration of actual model training and prediction, and thus, the task is considered failed.\n\nThe score reflects the high quality of the code itself, but the 'pass' status is false due to the critical execution failure.
