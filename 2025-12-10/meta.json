Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split) using `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`.\n3. Build a simple feedforward neural network using `tf.keras.Sequential`:\n    *   An input `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer suitable for the number of features.\n    *   A hidden `Dense` layer with 32 units and `relu` activation.\n    *   Another hidden `Dense` layer with 16 units and `relu` activation.\n    *   An output `Dense` layer with 1 unit and `sigmoid` activation.\n4. Compile the model with `optimizer='adam'`, `loss='binary_crossentropy'`, and `metrics=['accuracy']`.\n5. Train the model on the training data for a fixed number of epochs (e.g., 50) with a batch size (e.g., 32), storing the training history.\n6. Evaluate the trained model on the test set and print the test accuracy.\n7. Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs from the training history using `matplotlib.pyplot`, clearly labeling the axes and providing a title.",

        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate's Python code is exceptionally well-written and thoroughly fulfills every aspect of the task:\n\n1.  **Dataset Generation:** Correctly uses `make_moons` with specified `n_samples`, `noise`, and `random_state`.\n2.  **Data Split:** Implements an 80/20 train/test split using `train_test_split` with `random_state`. Crucially, it also correctly reshapes the target `y` arrays to `(-1, 1)`, which is good practice for Keras's binary classification output.\n3.  **Model Building:** Constructs a `tf.keras.Sequential` model with the correct layers, unit counts, and activation functions (`relu` for hidden, `sigmoid` for output). The `input_shape` is correctly specified on the first `Dense` layer.\n4.  **Model Compilation:** Compiles the model with the specified `adam` optimizer, `binary_crossentropy` loss, and `accuracy` metric.\n5.  **Model Training:** Trains the model for the specified 50 epochs with a batch size of 32. It also intelligently includes `validation_split=0.2` to monitor training and validation metrics, and `verbose=0` for clean output.\n6.  **Model Evaluation:** Correctly evaluates the trained model on the `X_test` and `y_test` sets and prints the test accuracy, formatted clearly.\n7.  **Plotting:** Generates clear and informative plots for both training/validation accuracy and loss over epochs using `matplotlib.pyplot`. All axes are clearly labeled, titles are provided, a legend is included, and `grid(True)` enhances readability. `plt.tight_layout()` is also a nice touch for presentation.\n\nDespite the 'Package install failure' in the execution stderr, which suggests an issue with the execution environment rather than the code itself (as the code contains no installation commands and standard ML libraries are assumed for such tasks), the logic and implementation provided by the candidate are flawless. The code is clean, robust, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the task and the Keras/TensorFlow framework.",
