Generate a synthetic classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` with at least 1000 samples, 5 numerical features, and 2 categorical features (one with 3 unique values, one with 5 unique values). Introduce missing values (e.g., `np.nan`) into two of the numerical features.\n2. Create an `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` to preprocess the data:\n    *   For numerical features: Impute missing values with the mean, then apply `StandardScaler`.\n    *   For categorical features: Apply `OneHotEncoder`.\n3. Construct an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies this `ColumnTransformer` and then trains a `RandomForestClassifier`.\n4. Evaluate the complete pipeline's performance using 5-fold cross-validation (`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`) and report the mean accuracy and its standard deviation.",

Missing values were thoughtfully introduced into two numerical features as requested, with appropriate checks printed.\n2.  **ColumnTransformer:** The `ColumnTransformer` is meticulously constructed. Numerical features are correctly processed through a `Pipeline` of `SimpleImputer` (mean strategy) and `StandardScaler`. Categorical features are processed with `OneHotEncoder`, including `handle_unknown='ignore'` for robustness.\n3.  **Pipeline Construction:** A `Pipeline` is correctly formed, integrating the `ColumnTransformer` as the first step and a `RandomForestClassifier` (with `random_state` for reproducibility) as the final estimator.\n4.  **Evaluation:** The pipeline is thoroughly evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation with `cross_val_score`, and both the mean accuracy and standard deviation are reported clearly.\n\nThe use of `pandas.DataFrame` for feature management, `random_state` for reproducibility, and informative print statements are all commendable practices. The 'Package install failure' in stderr is an environment issue unrelated to the correctness of the provided code's logic.",
