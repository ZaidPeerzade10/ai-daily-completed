Generate a synthetic classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` with at least 1000 samples, 5 numerical features, and 2 categorical features (one with 3 unique values, one with 5 unique values). Introduce missing values (e.g., `np.nan`) into two of the numerical features.\n2. Create an `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` to preprocess the data:\n    *   For numerical features: Impute missing values with the mean, then apply `StandardScaler`.\n    *   For categorical features: Apply `OneHotEncoder`.\n3. Construct an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies this `ColumnTransformer` and then trains a `RandomForestClassifier`.\n4. Evaluate the complete pipeline's performance using 5-fold cross-validation (`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`) and report the mean accuracy and its standard deviation.",
