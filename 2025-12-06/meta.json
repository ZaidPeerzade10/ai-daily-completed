Create two distinct `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` objects:\n    *   `pipeline_simple`: Consisting of `StandardScaler` followed by `LinearRegression`.\n    *   `pipeline_poly`: Consisting of `PolynomialFeatures` (set `degree=2`), then `StandardScaler`, then `LinearRegression`.\n3. Evaluate both pipelines using `sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score` with 5-fold cross-validation and `neg_mean_squared_error` as the scoring metric.\n4. Print the mean and standard deviation of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both pipelines, clearly indicating which result belongs to which pipeline. (Remember to convert `neg_mean_squared_error` to positive MSE values for interpretability).",

        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate code is exemplary and perfectly addresses all aspects of the task. \n\n1.  **Dataset Generation:** The `make_regression` function is used correctly, adhering to the specified parameters (500 samples, 3 informative features, noise). `random_state` ensures reproducibility.\n2.  **Pipeline Creation:** Both `pipeline_simple` and `pipeline_poly` are constructed flawlessly. `pipeline_simple` correctly sequences `StandardScaler` and `LinearRegression`. `pipeline_poly` correctly places `PolynomialFeatures` (with `degree=2` and the thoughtful `include_bias=False`) before `StandardScaler` and `LinearRegression`, ensuring that scaling is applied to the newly generated polynomial features, as specified in the hint and best practices.\n3.  **Model Evaluation:** `cross_val_score` is utilized effectively for both pipelines with 5-fold cross-validation and `neg_mean_squared_error` as the scoring metric, precisely as required.\n4.  **Results Printing:** The mean and standard deviation of the MSE are accurately calculated by correctly converting the negative scores to positive MSE values. The output is clearly labeled, well-formatted, and highly readable, allowing for easy comparison between the pipelines.\n\nThe overall structure, choice of modules, and adherence to best practices (like setting `random_state` and handling `neg_mean_squared_error`) are top-notch. The `pandas` import is unused but harmless. The 'Package install failure' reported in `stderr` is an environment-level problem and does not indicate any deficiency in the provided Python code itself, which is functionally correct and complete.",
