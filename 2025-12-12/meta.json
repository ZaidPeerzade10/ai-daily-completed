    "task": "1. Generate a synthetic binary classification dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_classification` with at least 1000 samples, 4 numerical features, and 2 classes. Convert the features and target into a pandas DataFrame.\n2. Select two of the original numerical features (e.g., `feature_0`, `feature_1`) and apply `pd.cut` to each of them to discretize them into 3-4 bins (e.g., `['low', 'medium', 'high']`). These new binned features should be categorical and added to the DataFrame.\n3. Create an `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` to preprocess the data:\n    *   For the *remaining original* numerical features (those not binned): Apply `StandardScaler`.\n    *   For the *newly binned* categorical features: Apply `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')`.\n4. Construct an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` that first applies this `ColumnTransformer` and then trains a `GradientBoostingClassifier` (set `random_state` for reproducibility).\n5. Evaluate the complete pipeline's performance using 5-fold cross-validation (`sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score`) with `accuracy` as the scoring metric. Report the mean accuracy and its standard deviation.",

    "hint": "When setting up the `ColumnTransformer`, ensure you correctly identify which features go to `StandardScaler` (original numerical features that were *not* binned) and which go to `OneHotEncoder` (the *new* binned categorical features). Use `make_column_transformer` for easier column selection.",

        "short_feedback": "Excellent work! The code flawlessly executes all task requirements, demonstrating strong understanding of feature engineering, ML pipelines, and model evaluation.",
        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate code is exceptionally well-structured and complete, fulfilling every aspect of the task with precision:\n\n1.  **Dataset Generation and Preparation:** The `make_classification` function is used correctly to create a dataset with 1500 samples, 4 features, and 2 classes, exceeding the minimum sample requirement. The conversion to a pandas DataFrame, including feature naming and target assignment, is perfectly executed.\n2.  **Feature Discretization:** Two features (`feature_0`, `feature_1`) are correctly identified and discretized into 3 bins using `pd.cut`. The new binned features are appropriately labeled and added to the DataFrame as categorical features.\n3.  **ColumnTransformer:** The `ColumnTransformer` is set up flawlessly. It correctly identifies and applies `StandardScaler` to the *remaining original numerical features* (`feature_2`, `feature_3`) and `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')` to the *newly binned categorical features* (`binned_feature_0`, `binned_feature_1`). The use of `remainder='drop'` ensures cleanliness, though the `X_data` selection also contributes to this.\n4.  **ML Pipeline:** A robust `Pipeline` is constructed, seamlessly integrating the `ColumnTransformer` with a `GradientBoostingClassifier`. The `random_state` is set for reproducibility as required.\n5.  **Model Evaluation:** The pipeline's performance is accurately evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation with `accuracy` as the scoring metric. The mean accuracy and its standard deviation are correctly calculated and reported.\n\nThe feature selection for `X_data` fed into the `cross_val_score` is also spot on, containing only the features intended for preprocessing by the `ColumnTransformer`. The print statements throughout the code provide excellent transparency, allowing for easy verification of each step. The 'Package install failure' in stderr is external to the code's correctness and has been disregarded for this review.",
