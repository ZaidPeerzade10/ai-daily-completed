Add a new categorical feature to the DataFrame (e.g., `group`) with 2-3 distinct values, randomly assigned.\n3.

        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate code is exceptionally well-written and meticulously fulfills all aspects of the task. \n\n1.  **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: `make_blobs` is used correctly with the specified parameters (500 samples, 4 features, 3 clusters, `random_state` for reproducibility). The conversion to a pandas DataFrame with `feature_names` and `cluster_id` is impeccable. Initial data inspection using `head()` and `info()` is a good practice.\n2.  **Categorical Feature Addition**: A `group` feature with 3 distinct, randomly assigned values is correctly added. The distribution check using `value_counts()` is appropriate.\n3.  **Visualizations**: All requested plots are generated correctly:\n    *   **Pair Plot**: `sns.pairplot` is used for numerical features, with points colored by `cluster_id` (`hue`) as required. The `palette='viridis'` is a good choice.\n    *   **Histograms/KDEs**: `sns.FacetGrid` is expertly employed to create separate histograms (with KDEs) for `feature_1` and `feature_2` based on the `group` categorical feature. `stat='density'` is suitable for comparing distributions.\n    *   **Box Plot**: A box plot for `feature_3` across different `cluster_id`s is correctly generated using `sns.boxplot`.\n4.  **Titles and Labels**: All plots have appropriate and descriptive titles and axis labels, demonstrating attention to detail and good visualization practices. `plt.tight_layout` is used to prevent overlaps.\n\n**Minor Observation (not affecting score)**: The `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))` call before `sns.pairplot` is redundant as `pairplot` creates its own figure. To set the size for `pairplot`, one would typically use `pair_plot.fig.set_size_inches(10, 8)` after the pairplot object is created. However, this does not cause any errors or negatively impact the output, as `pairplot`'s default sizing is often adequate.\n\nRegarding the 'Package install failure' in `stderr`, this is assumed to be an environmental issue during execution, not a flaw in the candidate code itself, which uses standard, widely available libraries correctly.",
