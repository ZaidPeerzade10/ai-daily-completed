Convert this into a pandas DataFrame, including the cluster labels as a feature (e.g., `cluster_id`).\n2. Add a new categorical feature to the DataFrame (e.g., `group`) with 2-3 distinct values, randomly assigned.\n3. Using `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`, create the following visualizations to explore the data:\n    *   A pair plot (`sns.pairplot`) for the numerical features, coloring the points by the `cluster_id`.\n    *   A set of histograms (or KDE plots) for `feature_1` and `feature_2`, separated for each unique value of the newly created `group` categorical feature (e.g., using `sns.FacetGrid` or `sns.histplot` with `hue` and `col`).\n    *   A box plot (or violin plot) showing the distribution of `feature_3` across the different `cluster_id`s.\n4. Ensure all plots have appropriate titles and labels.",

        "detailed_feedback": "The candidate code is exemplary. It meticulously addresses every point of the task description:\n\n1.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** Correctly uses `make_blobs` with `n_samples=1000` (exceeding the 500 minimum), 4 features, and 3 clusters. The data is accurately converted into a pandas DataFrame, including `cluster_id`.\n2.  **Categorical Feature Addition:** A `group` categorical feature with 3 distinct values ('Group A', 'Group B', 'Group C') is successfully added and randomly assigned.\n3.  **Visualizations:**\n    *   **Pair Plot:** `sns.pairplot` is used effectively, coloring points by `cluster_id` and setting `diag_kind='kde'` for better insights.\n    *   **Histograms/KDEs:** `sns.FacetGrid` is correctly utilized to create separated distributions for `feature_1` and `feature_2` across each unique `group` value, including KDE overlays.\n    *   **Box Plot:** A clear `sns.boxplot` is generated to show the distribution of `feature_3` across `cluster_id`s.\n4.  **Titles and Labels:** All plots, including the FacetGrid subplots, have appropriate and descriptive titles and axis labels. The use of `y=1.02` for `suptitle` and `tight_layout` demonstrates attention to detail in plot presentation.\n\nAdditional commendable aspects include the use of `sns.set_style` and `plt.rcParams['figure.dpi']` for consistent plot aesthetics, and informative print statements for dataset inspection. The 'Package install failure' noted in the execution stderr is an environment issue, not a flaw in the provided Python code's logic or implementation.",
